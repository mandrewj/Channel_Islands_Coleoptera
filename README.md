# Channel_Islands_Coleoptera
Data and scripts to analyze beetle diversity on the California Channel Islands


## R script
The ChannelIslands.R script contains all of the code used to generate statistics and figures for this project. The only data required for the scripts are contained in island_data.csv.

The R script contains several vectors of data which were obtained from the occurrence data in the included tab-delimited files. Documentation about how those data were parsed from the files is given within the R script.
